## About

This mobile application is built using Swift 5.0 and Xcode 11.0 for iOS devices running iOS 13.0.

If attempting to run this code on future versions of Swift, Xcode, or iOS some additional work may be required to get this code running smoothly.

## Quick Start

The following steps will guide you through the process of running this application on your local machine, and device.

1. Ensure you have [Xcode 11.0](https://developer.apple.com/download/) installed
2. Ensure you have [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) installed
3. Checkout this repository
4. Open `WiproTest.xcodeproj` with Xcode
5. Go to the project settings, and change the code signing team to your own

Code signing settings are left at automatic here for simplicity, you can set these to manual if needed but these steps will not take you through that process.
